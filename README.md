# RaspiClock
A simple fullscreen clock designed for Raspberry Pi in Python/Tkinter

This clock was a test project for people wanting a NTP synchronized clock with various functions like changing digits color or hiding seconds.

A config file "RaspiClock_config.ini" created and stored in the same folder as the script is used to configure the clock.
